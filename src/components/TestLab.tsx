  problem: string;
  solution: string;
  realLifeExample: string;
  staffEngineeringDepth: string;
}> = {
  blast: {
    problem: "When user traffic spikes suddenly (e.g., ticket sales or viral media surges), thousands of concurrent TCP sockets connect simultaneously. If the database connection pool is under-provisioned, or if blockages creep into the event loop, thread starvation sets in. The system spends more CPU cycles switching execution contexts than completing productive work (CPU Thrashing), escalating latencies exponentially until the service timeouts or crashes (504 Gateway Timeouts).",
    solution: "CONCURRENT_BLAST testing floods the target with high-density parallel requests to identify thread pool bounds and database connection limits. By tracking API throughput (RPS) against scaling concurrency levels, we pinpoint the exact 'saturation inflection point' where throughput plateaus or drops while latencies rise sharply.",
    realLifeExample: "A ticket vendor opens sales for a stadium show. Within 500ms of open-time, 50,000 requests hit the /checkout endpoint. The database connection pool is configured to a maximum of 20 connections; Postgres immediately queue-blocks connections. Node's event loop waits, Redis queries time out, and the entire API cluster fails under cascade backlog.",
    staffEngineeringDepth: "To prevent thread starvation, decouple slow databases using event queues, increase database connection pools using multiplexers (e.g., PgBouncer), and integrate active load shedding (e.g., serving fast 503 errors when request queues exceed 200ms) to shelter the system from collapse."
  },
  race: {
    problem: "Non-atomic update logic (Read-Modify-Write) allows 'dirty writes' when overlapping requests read identical state before changes write back. For example, if two payment requests query a $100 balance simultaneously, both see $100 and approve the spend. Both write back a remaining $50, resulting in $100 spent but a $50 final balance.",
    solution: "RACE_DETECTOR injects tight concurrent payload mutations in a sub-millisecond window targeting the exact same record, trying to force state write collisions and highlighting missing row-level serialization or distributed locks.",
    realLifeExample: "A flash sale occurs for a limited-stock console. Shoppers hit the 'Buy' trigger at the exact same millisecond. Multiple threads check 'stock_count = 1', validate, and decrement inventory. Both purchases succeed, resulting in double-allocation and overselling.",
    staffEngineeringDepth: "Mitigate race conditions using Pessimistic Locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE) to lock database rows down during a read, Optimistic Locking (WHERE version = X) to fail operations if the record has moved, or distributed lock managers like Redis Redlock across dynamic cluster nodes."
  },
  replay: {
    problem: "Noisy or malicious clients can intercept and resubmit identical request headers, signatures, or payloads. If transaction mutations lack deduplication checks, they process again, causing duplicate billing, duplicate item creation, or broken state integrity.",
    solution: "REPLAY_GUARD clones authorization headers, payload structures, and telemetry markers, resending identical signatures sequentially to verify that the backend implements transaction-uniqueness constraints (Idempotency Guards) and safely logs duplicates.",
    realLifeExample: "An unstable mobile connection causes a user's delivery request to hang. The app automatically retries. The web gateway processes each retry as a brand new command, generating three separate delivery orders and triple-charging the credit card.",
    staffEngineeringDepth: "Enforce strict idempotency using unique Idempotency-Key headers on all mutative requests (POST/PATCH). Store these transaction keys in Redis with a short TTL (e.g., 24h). If a key state is 'Processing', return a transient lock-wait; if 'Completed', immediately serve the cached response without running downstream controllers."
  },
  load: {
    problem: "Longer execution runs surface bugs that quick spikes miss. Gradual degradation (Performance Rot) from memory leaks, file descriptor starvation, index fragmentation, or un-garbage-collected heaps slowly pushes latency baselines up and crashes servers after hours of flawless usage.",
    solution: "LOAD_CANNON runs extended, continuous request queues to test garbage collection efficiency, heap allocation trends, socket exhaustion under heavy load, and database slow-query regressions.",
    realLifeExample: "An IoT telemetry engine receives data packets every minute. A tiny memory leak in an incoming string parser retains characters on the V8 heap. The microservice operates perfectly for 6 hours, then silently heaps out and crashes.",
    staffEngineeringDepth: "Monitor Heap Allocation graphs during sustained load. Add strict timeouts to downstream connections to prevent file descriptor leaks, index critical query predicates, and set up alert limits at 80% RAM utilization to trigger controlled canary rolling restarts."
  },
  chaos: {
    problem: "In microservice topologies, external networks, caches, or third-party gateways will eventually fail or run slow. If dependencies act synchronously without protection, a failure in a minor metadata service cascadingly starves threads across the entire ecosystem.",
    solution: "CHAOS_MODE simulates network packet drops, connection closures, and high latency targets. This assesses whether circuit breakers, graceful degradation states, and timeout policies successfully guard primary customer flows.",
    realLifeExample: "A shop's main product page tries to load item details, stock count, and personal recommendations. The recommendation service suffers a network timeout. Since the main route calls the service synchronously without key protection, the entire product page hangs and errors out with a 500 error instead of simply hiding recommendations.",
    staffEngineeringDepth: "Wrap third-party and non-essential queries in resilient Circuit Breakers (such as Cockatiel or Hystrix), configure aggressive 500-1000ms socket timeouts, and return static fallbacks or cached models when downstream services fail."
  },
  rate: {
    problem: "Unrestricted public APIs are highly vulnerable to scraping, brute-force hacking, credit card testing, and general Denial of Service (DoS) sweeps. If endpoints don't restrict repetitive queries, they consume high database resources, elevate operating costs, and block legitimate traffic.",
    solution: "RATE_BREAKER initiates fast, iterative bursts of identical target requests to detect rate limits, monitoring if HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) boundaries trigger and verifying back-off response headers (e.g., Retry-After).",
    realLifeExample: "An authentication route /api/login lacks rate limits. An attacker runs a dictionary attack, executing 100 requests per second using distinct password lists, overwhelming CPU-heavy bcrypt hashing blocks and locking up the server database.",
    staffEngineeringDepth: "Deploy sliding-window or token-bucket rate limit algorithms on edge gateways (e.g., Cloudflare, Nginx, API Gateway) rather than application code. Leverage Redis to aggregate key-hits mapped to user IDs or Client IPs with short sliding windows (e.g., 60 seconds)."
  },
  fuzzer: {
    problem: "API modules parse untrusted payloads assuming structures are correct. Lacking strict schema isolation, unescaped field entries, type casting errors, or unexpected keys can trigger backend interpreter crashes, unhandled database queries, or server crashes.",
    solution: "PAYLOAD_FUZZER alters payload variables, deletes keys, swaps types, and introduces giant buffers, proving that parser systems reject invalid input formats cleanly without leaking deep runtime traces or crashing the event loop.",
    realLifeExample: "A search endpoint parses a filters query: {\"price\": 100}. An attacker injects MongoDB operators: {\"price\": {\"$gt\": 0}}. The database runs the query literally, exposing the entire product database rather than raising an invalid query exception.",
    staffEngineeringDepth: "Integrate schema validation engines (such as Zod, AJV, or Joi) at the controller gateway. Adhere to a 'Parse, Don't Validate' design philosophy: strictly convert incoming payloads into sanitized, strongly typed model objects before forwarding data to internal service modules."
  },
  scenario: {
    problem: "An individual endpoint can pass validation perfectly, yet state transitions across multiple endpoints (e.g., Register -> Order -> Refund) create edge cases like orphaned payments, inconsistent inventory allocations, or invalid transition logic.",
    solution: "SCENARIO_RUNNER executes stateful chains of API operations to test end-to-end user journeys, ensuring state changes propagate cleanly across sequential microservices and audit logs.",
    realLifeExample: "A flight checkout process charges a customer's card, reserves a seat, and sends a booking code. If reservation is broken, the money is captured, but the seat remains unallocated and the system leaves the order state 'broken' without issuing a rollback.",
    staffEngineeringDepth: "Implement Saga Orchestration or Process Managers for distributed sagas. Leverage transactional outbox patterns to make sure actions commit together, and store state changes as persistent event records to facilitate point-in-time failure recovery."
  },
  security_audit: {
    problem: "Applications with inputs directly bound to query strings, SQL statements, or HTML renders are prone to injection vectors: SQLi, XSS, Path Traversal, or missing Sandbox headers. Attackers exploit these gaps to steal databases, read root files, or hijack active browser sessions.",
    solution: "SECURITY_AUDITOR tests fields by injecting malicious patterns (e.g., ' OR 1=1 --, <script>, and traversals) to inspect if error paths reflect raw backends, checking if response headers correctly sanitize client-side contexts.",
    realLifeExample: "An endpoint loads files via /api/view?file=item.pdf. An attacker accesses /api/view?file=../../../../etc/passwd, bypassing authorization to read the host operating system's user credentials directly.",
    staffEngineeringDepth: "Maintain defence-in-depth: decouple user parameters using Prepared / Parameterized Queries, purify HTML output using DOMPurify, lock file lookups to strict static folders, and configure strict security headers (CSP, HSTS, XSS-Protection, X-Frame-Options)."
  },
  distributed: {
    problem: "Standard single-origin load tests hit endpoints from a single client subnet or physical machine, missing downstream DNS caching, multi-continent Cloudflare routing filters, third-party ISP throttling, or incorrect client IP parsing issues on API load-balancers.",
    solution: "DISTRIBUTED_LOAD spoofs standard industry CDN headers (X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, Client-IP) and dynamically inserts typical geographical speed parameters, validating how the core network buffers realistic worldwide loads.",
    realLifeExample: "A global service uses regional rate-limiting or location-based firewalls. A simple QA run completes fine locally, but sudden customer load bursts in Sydney block Japanese endpoints entirely due to missing routing filters.",
    staffEngineeringDepth: "Implement CDN boundary authentication and strict upstream proxy verification. Configure secure 'trust proxy' patterns inside framework controllers to bypass artificial IP header tampering while safely identifying origin IPs for client diagnostics."
